# result = round(x) # Round number to the nearest whole number. 
# result = abs(z1) # Absolute value of number, -5 is going to be 5. 
# result = pow(4, 3) # Power function, 4 to the power of 3. 
# result = max(x, y, z) # The largest value from the range available.
# result = min(x, y, z) # The smallest value from the range available.

# Useful Math Constants and Functions for Math, to use them we will need to import the math module.

# print(math.pi) # Use this to print the Pi value
# print(math.e) # Use this to print the expontential value
# result = math.sqrt(z2) # Use this to get the square root of a value. 
# result = math.ceil(x) # Round the number up to the nearest whole number. 
# result = math.floor(x) # Round the number down to the nearest whole number.
# print(result)
