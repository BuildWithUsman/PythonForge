# for loops = Execute a block of code for a fixed number of times. 
#             You can iterate over a range, stirng, sequence, etc. 

# for x in range(1, 11): # Second number mentioned in the range is exlcusive, so if you want to print 1 to 10 your end number would 11.
#                        # X is the variable storing the value, you can also use counter instead of x as the variable. 
#     print(x)

for x in reversed(range(1, 11)): # To print the numbers 1 to 10 reversed you would use "reversed" and enclose it within the range.   
    print(x)

print("Happy New Year!")
